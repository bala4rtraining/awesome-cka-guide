# Important notes

Files here are symlinks to the actual secure boot image files
downloaded from OVN git repo to this laptop.  

They are used by the OGL to install orange servers.
Same set of files will be copied to the orange servers after they
are installed so they can be used by orange servers to install 
regular OVN nodes.

On the orange server, these files are in roles/pxe/files/secureboot 
directory
