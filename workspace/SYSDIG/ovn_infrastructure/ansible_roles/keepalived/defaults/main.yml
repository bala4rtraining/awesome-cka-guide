#haproxy_interface
#haproxy_virtual_ip

# For example,
#
#[haproxy]
#10.13.200.18
#10.13.200.19
#
#[haproxy:vars]
#haproxy_interface=eth2  ( Note this will be different depending on environment, whether the server is a VM or a hardware )

# Per HAproxy settings
#
# Note: Now we don't have any
#       preference which happroxy server
#       is the master or backup.
#       So they are treated equal with
#       same priority and both are in
#       BACKUP state. It's best to leave them
#       this way.
