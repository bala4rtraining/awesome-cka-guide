# All these `http_conn` options are required as an artifact of the `riak` module
# implementation.  There's an unecessary tight coupling in the `riak` module between
# the command execution timeouts and the availability of Riak's HTTP interface.
# Even though the commands themselves don't require the HTTP interface for anything.
#
# It would be nice to fix the `riak` module so it doesn't have this problem anymore.
