## This site.yml file isn't intended to be used by itself for any purpose other than
## to keep the current Jenkins riak deploy job from breaking.
##
## At some point this file could be reworked to fit the normal use case of a site.yml
## file, but right now it's just a wrapper for all these different parts the Jenkins
## job expects to happen.
##
## Future Jenkins jobs that need to interact with Riak should do so by running these,
## or other, top-level playbooks directly in separate build steps.

# provision riak nodes
- include: provision.yml

# join the provisioned riak nodes into a cluster 
- include: admin_join.yml

# run playbooks to apply OVN app specific properties 
- include: configure_advice.yml
