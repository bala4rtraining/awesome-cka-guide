# These are north-south firewall rules for the `INDONESIA` (dci, telin) cluster only.
#
# The rules are the same as for the `firewall_north_south_rule.yml`
# except the rules defined here only applies to this cluster.
#
# One should consider twice before adding rules here.
# That is one should consult with others and add the rule to the global
# `north_south_firewall_rules` before coming here to add the rule.
