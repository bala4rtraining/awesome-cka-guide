# TSR Remediation Playbooks

Included in this project are playbooks that will address TSR findings against OVN.

Remediation should be written as sub-playbook under the ```remediation```Â sub-directory and all of them should be included in ```main.yml```.

### tsr_7583
This will lock inactive user accounts after 90 days
editing /etc/default/useradd file to have INACTIVE=90

### tsr_8858
This will set sticky bit to directories 
RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type. For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories like /tmp. For regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit
### tsr_8872
Create and set permissions on rsyslog log files to 600
### tsr_8869
This will remove the world writable file permissions 
### tsr_4829
This will remove telnet package 
### tsr_6715
This will set default ClientAliveInterval 900 and ClientAliveCountMax 0 in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
