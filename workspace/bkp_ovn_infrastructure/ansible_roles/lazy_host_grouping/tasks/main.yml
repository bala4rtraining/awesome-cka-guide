# tasks file for lazy_host_grouping

# this role attempts to create dynamic inventory groups by looking for
# facts local to each host stored in /etc/ansible/facts.d/provisioned.facts
#
# the role folds over all keys in that file in an ini section called 'as'
# and where the value for that key is 'yes' it creates a group and adds
# the host to that group.
#
# and example /etc/ansible/facts.d/provisioned.facts file might look like:
#
# [as]
# kafka=yes
# zookeeper=yes
#
# in the case that this file and these values don't exist the host will
# automatically be added to a group called 'unprovisioned'
