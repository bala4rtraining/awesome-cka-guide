# This should be the only thing that actually lives in the main.yml file.
#
# The purpose of this is to allow calling into the role via the `roles:`
# shorthand from the playbook level, and then passing in a role-scoped
# variable `dispatch`, which should be the names of the other role/tasks/*.yml
# files you want to be invoked by the playbook call to the role.
#
# The other task files will be included, and thus executed in the order
# originally placed in the dispatch list `dispatch: [first, second, third, etc]`
