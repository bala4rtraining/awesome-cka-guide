# This is the main file for running Ansible
# on rescue to configure OOB switches
#
# This playbook uses hosts + group_vars/oob
#
# NOTE: This should be run separately AFTER
#       the top level site.yml playbook is run.
#
#       This playbook will need to use the host inventory
#       and group vars created by the top level site.yml
