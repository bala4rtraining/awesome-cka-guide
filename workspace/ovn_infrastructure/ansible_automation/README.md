# Automation playbooks

The playbooks and roles are for provisioning and deployment automation tools such as jenkins, docker
setting up ssh access to stash, etc.

We are committed implementing ansible playbooks and roles following the `Ansible Best Practices` guidelines.

Automation inventory is under the `inventories/automation` directory.
