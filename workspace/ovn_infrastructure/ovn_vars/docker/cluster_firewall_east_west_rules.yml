# These are east-west firewall rules for the `DEV` (dev1, dev2) cluster only.
#
# The rules are the same as for the `firewall_east_west_rule.yml`
# except the rules defined here only applies to this cluster.
#
# One should consider twice before adding rules here.
# That is one should consult with others and add the rule to the global
# `east_west_firewall_rules` before coming here to add the rule.

# Since `kerberos_server` is valid for Dev environment only, we can't add firewall rules to global ones. 
# Once its available for other environments, we will move this rules to global firewall_east_west_rule.yml
