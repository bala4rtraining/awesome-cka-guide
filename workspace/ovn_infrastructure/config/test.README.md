##### Test OVN Cluster

* Environment specific variables are located in environment specific configuration file (`test.vars.yml`)

###### Note

Until OVN Cluster/OVN Manager networking issues are resolved:
1. OVN Cluster inventory uses IP addresses (`test.inventory`)
2. Ansible authenticates to OVN Cluster machines as `root` using private/key pair, please contact `vspichek@visa.com` to obtain the key
