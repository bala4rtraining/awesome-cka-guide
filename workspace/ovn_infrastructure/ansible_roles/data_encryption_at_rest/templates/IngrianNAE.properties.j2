Version=2.4


#[Network Configuration]
# [NAE Server IP and Port]
# The IP address and port of the NAE server.
#
# Multiple IPs can be specified when load balancing is used. 
# For all tier-aware parameters, the tier is indicated with a trailing
# :n after the parameter name, i.e. NAE_IP.1=127.0.0.1
# Setting the parameter with no tier sets the default value for all tiers.
# i.e. Connection_Timeout=600000 sets Connection_Timeout for all tiers while
# Connection_Timeout.1=700000 sets Connection_Timeout for tier 1.
#
# Multiple IPs are separated by colons, e.g.,
# 192.168.1.10:192.168.1.11:192.168.1.12
#
NAE_IP.1={{safenet_IngrianNAE_properties_NAE_IP}}

#[Network Configuration]
# [NAE Server Port]
# NAE_Port is tier-aware
# Do not set the port value to 9443 because this is the port typically used
# to connect to the management console.
NAE_Port={{safenet_IngrianNAE_properties_NAE_Port}}

#[Network Configuration]
# [Ignore_DNS_Resolution_Failure]
# Ignore_DNS_Resolution_Failure is used in case either JCE Application fails to locate DNS Server.
# or If Host Name present in any Ip Field is not getting resolved through DNS.Application will shift to Persistance chache if it is on.
Ignore_DNS_Resolution_Failure=false

#[Network Configuration]
# [KMIP Server Port]
# KMIP_Port is tier-aware
# By convention, the KMIP standard port is 5696, but this is not enforced,
# or taken as default by JCE. Must be a KMIP SSL port on the server.
# Do not set the port value to 9443 because this is the port typically used
# to connect to the management console. 
KMIP_Port=5696

#[Network Configuration]
# [Protocol]
# The protocol used between the client and the NAE server.
#
# Protocol is tier-aware.
# Valid values: tcp, ssl.
# Default: tcp
# Recommended: ssl
#
#Protocol=tcp
Protocol=ssl

# All connection configuration properties effect the connection set up.
# 
#[Connection Configuration]
# [Verify_SSL_Certificate]
# This property is considered only when Protocol is set to ssl.
# 
# Enable or disable verification of DataSecure IP address/host name
# against Subject Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (DNS or IP)
# in the certificate.
#
# Valid values: yes, no.
# Default: no
# Recommended: yes
#
Verify_SSL_Certificate=no

#[Connection Configuration]
# [SSL_Handshake_Timeout]
# This property is considered only when Protocol is set to ssl.
#
# Allocates a time for SSL handshake. If SSL handshake is not complete
# within this time period, the connection is closed.
#
# The value is specified in milliseconds.
#
# If the value is set to 0 or is not set, SSL handshake timeout
# is not enforced.
# 
SSL_Handshake_Timeout=

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Persistent Connections]
# Enable or disable persistent connections.
#
# If enabled, the client will use a pool of persistent connections to the
# NAE server. If disabled, a new connection will be created and then
# closed for each request.
#
# Valid values: yes, no.
# Default: yes
# Recommended: yes
#
Use_Persistent_Connections=yes


#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Pooling]
# The maximum number of connections in the persistent connection pool per session.
#
# This value is used only when persistent connections are enabled.
#
# Size_of_Connection_Pool is tier-aware.
# Default: 300
#
Size_of_Connection_Pool=300

#[Connection Configuration]
#[Load Balancing Configuration]
# The type of load balancing.
#
# This value is only relevant if you are load balancing across multiple
# NAE servers.
#
# Valid values: random, round-robin.
# Default: round-robin
#
Load_Balancing_Algorithm=round-robin

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Idle Timeout]
# The time a connection is allowed to be idle in the connection pool
# before it gets closed automatically by the client.
#
# The timeout can be specified in any time units (default - milliseconds). The client 
# will check how long each connection has been idle for. If the time has passed the value
# specified here, the client will close the connection and remove it from
# the connection pool. To be effective, this setting must be less than the
# Connection Timeout setting in the NAE Server Settings section in the
# Management Console of the NAE server.
#
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite timeout.
# Connection_Idle_Timeout is tier-aware.
# Default: 600000
#
Connection_Idle_Timeout=600000

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Unreachable Server Retry]
# The amount of time to try establishing a connection if all servers
# in the pool become unreachable.
#
# The retry period can be specified in any time units (default - milliseconds). An error is returned
# after the specified period if no server in the pool becomes reachable.
# If logging is enabled, error messages will be logged to the log file.
#
# Setting this value to -1 is equivalent to an infinite retry period. The
# client will keep trying to connect to a server until a connection is
# established.
#
# Setting this value to -1 is not compatible with multi-tier load
# balancing because the load balancer will never switch to the secondary
# or tertiary pools. 
#
# Default: 60000 (1 minute)
#
Unreachable_Server_Retry_Period=60000

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Maximum_Server_Retry_Period]
# The total amount of time to spend trying to make connections on any tier.
# This value only has meaning when using multi-tiered load balancing.
# If this value is set to -1 (try forever), the connection manager will try 
# every server on every tier continually, until one answers.
# If this value is enabled, the connection manager will try to make connections
# for at least Maximum_Server_Retry_Period time but will return
# an error if no connection can be made on the tier in use when
# Maximum_Server_Retry_Period expires.
# Maximum_Server_Retry_Period is tier-aware.
#
# Default: 0 (disabled)
#
Maximum_Server_Retry_Period=0

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Timeout]
# The timeout when connecting to the NAE server.
#
# The timeout can be specified in any time units (default - milliseconds). The client 
# will wait for the specified time when trying to connect to each NAE
# server. If the timeout expires, an NAEException will be thrown.
#
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite timeout.
#
# Caution: Setting this value too low (but not 0) may cause connections to
# fail when the NAE servers and/or network are under load.
#
# Connection_Timeout is tier-aware.
# Default: 1 minute
#
Connection_Timeout=1m


#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Read Timeout]
# The timeout when reading from the NAE server.
#
# The timeout can be specified in any time units (default - milliseconds). The client 
# will wait for the specified time when trying to read data from the NAE
# server. If the timeout expires, an NAEException will be thrown.
#
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite timeout.
# Connection_Read_Timeout is tier-aware.
# Default: 7000
#
Connection_Read_Timeout=7000

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Connection Retry]
# The amount of time to wait before trying to reconnect to a disabled
# server.
#
# The retry interval can be specified in any time units (default - milliseconds). 
# If one of the NAE servers in a load balanced configuration is not reachable,
# the client will disable this server, and then wait for the specified 
# time before trying to connect to it again.
#
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite retry interval
# (meaning the disabled server will never be brought back into use).
#
# Connection_Retry_Interval is tier-aware.
#
# Default: 600000
#
Connection_Retry_Interval=600000

#[Client Certificate Configuration]
# [Client Certificate Alias]
# The client certificate to present to the NAE server.
#
# This value is only relevant when client certificate authentication is
# enabled on the NAE server. The certificate must be in PEM format.
#
# When there are multiple client certificates in your keystore, you can
# specify which certificate gets sent to the NAE server. If you do not
# specify an alias, the first certificate in the keystore will be sent.
#
# You should provide the alias of the client certificate.
# Client_Cert_Alias is tier-aware.
# No default.
#
Client_Cert_Alias={{safenet_IngrianNAE_properties_Client_Cert_Alias}}

# Enable or disable Etoken.
#
# If enabled, the client will use a Etoken to make ssl connection with
# DS server. If disabled, a new connection will be created using local
# keystore for SSL Connection. This configuration will work only when 
# protocol is ssl.
#
# Valid values: yes, no.
# Default: no
Use_Etoken=no
#[Etoken Configuration]
# The Etoken Name is used to connect with
# PKCS#11 hardware.

#[Connection Configuration]
# [Cluster_Synchronization_Delay]
# The total amount of time to spend trying to make requests on keys
# go to the same device the key create or latest key modify went to.
#
# A device tries to replicate key information to other devices in the
# cluster after it completes a key create or modify request.  Until
# that replication completes, requests on the key need to go to the
# device pushing the replication.
#
# If replication fails, the device waits for 30 seconds, then
# tries again.  If three replications fail, the device stops trying
# to replicate data.
#
# The default is 100 seconds: 3 times 30 seconds plus a few extra
# seconds per try for network latency.  For larger clusters additional
# time may be needed.
#
# Disable the function: 0 seconds
#
# Default: 100 seconds
#
Cluster_Synchronization_Delay=100

# [Client Key Caching]
# [Symmetric_Key_Cache_Enabled]
# Enables symmetric key caching.
#
# If enabled, the client will be able to use symmetric keys to encrypt data
# locally. If disabled, only remote encryption will be supported.  Should only be
# enabled with Protocol set to ssl.  To allow key caching over unsecured
# communication, set this variable to tcp_ok
#
# Valid values: yes, no, tcp_ok
# Default: no
# Recommended: no

# Time period since key was cached after which a symmetric key
# may be removed from cache. Symmetric_Key_Cache_Expiry can be specified
# in any time units (default - seconds)
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to an infinite timeout.
# Note: This field is also applicable to Asymmetric key cache expiry
# Default: 43200 (12 hours)
#Symmetric_Key_Cache_Expiry=43200
Symmetric_Key_Cache_Expiry={{safenet_IngrianNAE_properties_Symetric_Key_Cache_Expiry}}


# [Client Key Caching]
# [Local_Cipher_Cache_Expiry]
# Time period since local cipher was initialize with cached key.
# Local_Cipher_Expiry can be specified in any time units (default - milliseconds)
# Setting this value to 0 is equivalent to no timeout which means cipher will
# expire after every operation. 
# To do local cipher expiry, Symmetric_Key_Cache_Enabled must be set to 
# "yes" or "tcp_ok.
#
# Note: Local_Cipher_Expiry timeout should be less than Symmetric_Key_Cache_Expiry
# because all ciphers will get expired on symmetric cache expiry. 
# Default: 0 (cipher will expiry every time)
#Local_Cipher_Cache_Expiry=0
Local_Cipher_Cache_Expiry={{safenet_IngrianNAE_properties_Local_Cipher_Cache_Expiry}}

# Valid values: yes, no
# Default: no
# Recommended: no
Persistent_Cache_Enabled=no


# [Persistent Key Caching]
# [Persistent_Cache_Expiry_Keys]
#
# Time since stored after which a key may be removed from key cache. 
# Settiing to 0 would mean no timeout and keys would not be removed
# from key cache. Persistent_Cache_Expiry_Keys can be specified
# in any time units (default - seconds)
# 
# Default: 43200 (12 hours)
Persistent_Cache_Expiry_Keys=43200
